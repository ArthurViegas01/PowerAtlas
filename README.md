# PowerAtlas

Interactive power-mapping HUD for Brazil: for each region (national + states),
an **official power** ranking (constitutional offices) rendered side by side
with a **hidden / real influence** ranking (institutions, organizations,
factions), on top of a tactical-HUD map interface (dark, cyan/amber,
scanlines, corner brackets, monospace readouts).

> **Phase 1 status: UI prototype with simulated data.** Every "hidden power"
> entity in this repository is **fictional** (e.g. "Instituição Federal
> Alpha") and every score is a placeholder. Nothing here is a claim about any
> real person or organization. The real data pipeline — with visible sources
> and mandatory human review before anything is published — is Phase 2+.
> The UI keeps a permanent "simulated data" banner for this reason.

## Status

**F1 — Brazil HUD over mock data: shipped 2026-07-15.** Full HUD shell,
MapLibre + deck.gl layers (state choropleth, twin capital columns, influence
arcs, ambient heatmap), GSAP choreography with reduced-motion gating, IBGE
boundary pipeline, fictional dataset.

**F2 — "coming soon" world backdrop: shipped 2026-07-15 (v0.2.0).** Natural
Earth world layer rendered as a locked, not-yet-mapped zone (dim fill +
dashed borders), global view button and the "área bloqueada" panel.

Deviations from the original plans: [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) §3
and [docs/data-sources.md](docs/data-sources.md). Next phases (FastAPI
backend, PostGIS, scoring pipeline, review workflow): ARCHITECTURE.md §6.

## Stack (Phase 1)

- Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite, Pinia for state
- MapLibre GL JS base map + deck.gl overlay (choropleth, 3D columns at state
  capitals, influence arcs, ambient heatmap)
- GSAP for HUD choreography — all motion gated behind `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Tailwind CSS v4 layered over hand-written design tokens
  (`apps/web/src/styles/tokens.css`)
- Self-hosted Fira Code / Fira Sans (no font CDN)
- Boundaries: IBGE malha territorial, simplified — see `docs/data-sources.md`
- World backdrop: Natural Earth 110m rendered as a dim, dashed
  "em breve" zone — the whole globe is visible, but only Brazil is mapped
  for now

## Getting started

Requires Node >= 22 and pnpm >= 10 (`npm i -g pnpm`).

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev        # Vite dev server on http://localhost:5173
pnpm build      # vue-tsc type-check + production build
pnpm preview    # serve the production build on http://localhost:4173
pnpm geo        # re-fetch + simplify IBGE boundaries (needs network)
```

Equivalent `make web-*` targets exist in the Makefile for machines with GNU
make installed.

Dev tip: `http://localhost:5173/?region=SP` deep-links straight into a
region's ranking panel (any UF sigla or `BR`).

### Development notes

- deck.gl subpackages (`core`, `layers`, `aggregation-layers`, `mapbox`) are
  released in lockstep — always upgrade them to the same minor together, or
  picking/rendering breaks subtly.
- Vite binds all interfaces (`server.host: true`); rationale in the comment
  in `apps/web/vite.config.ts` (IPv6-only localhost binding breaks IPv4
  clients).
- Adding or editing mock data? The fictional-entities-only content-safety
  rule (ARCHITECTURE.md §5) is non-negotiable in this phase.

### Manual QA checklist

1. `pnpm build` green (vue-tsc + vite).
2. Dev server: full-viewport HUD, national outline + 27 states render, no
   console errors.
3. Click São Paulo: scan effect fires, both ranking columns stagger in,
   counters tween, confidence badges and source tags render.
4. Click a state without data (e.g. MG): graceful "sem dados" panel, no
   crash.
5. Emulate `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`: stagger/scan/scanline disabled.
6. `pnpm preview`: click-through matches dev (catches `public/geo`
   asset-path issues).
7. Zoom out (or "VISÃO GLOBAL"): dim dashed world appears; hovering a
   country reads "EM BREVE"; clicking one opens the "área bloqueada" panel.
